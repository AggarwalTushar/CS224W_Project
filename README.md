## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting future earthquake events Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We utilize a real-world dataset, where nodes represent geographic locations and times and edges represent interactions. The goal is to predict whether a location will face earthquake in the future based on historical data.

## Repository Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset.
- `src/`: Contains source code for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis.
- `results/`: Contains results from model training and evaluation.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
    git clone
    https://github.com/AggarwalTushar/CS224W_Project.git
    cd CS224W_Project
    ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Acknowledgments
We would like to thank the instructors and TAs of the CS224W course for their guidance and support throughout the quarter.
